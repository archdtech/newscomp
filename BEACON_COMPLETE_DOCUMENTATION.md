# Beacon Compliance Intelligence Platform - Complete Development Documentation

## 📋 Project Overview

Beacon is a comprehensive AI-powered compliance intelligence platform designed to eliminate information overload for compliance managers while ensuring they never miss critical regulatory or operational risks. This platform transforms hours of manual monitoring into minutes of intelligent, automated operations.

### 🎯 Product Vision
Make Beacon the indispensable daily intelligence source for compliance managers.

### 🚀 Core Hypothesis
Compliance managers spend significant weekly hours manually monitoring regulatory changes and vendor stability. Beacon reduces this to minutes daily while providing superior coverage and earlier warnings.
