3. **Production Build**: Switched to production build instead of development server for stability
4. **Port Configuration**: Used port 8080 to avoid conflicts and ensure proper content delivery
5. **Basic Layout**: Created minimal working layout with essential components only

#### Code Changes Made
```typescript
// Updated layout.tsx - Removed Clerk authentication
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" dir="ltr" suppressHydrationWarning={true}>
      <body className={`${inter.variable} font-sans antialiased bg-background text-foreground`}>
        <div className="min-h-screen bg-background">

### 2. Server Port Conflicts (RESOLVED)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
**Date**: June 20, 2025
**Impact**: High - Server was crashing and restarting continuously

#### Issue Description
The development server was experiencing `EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:3000` errors, causing the server to crash and restart repeatedly. This resulted in the UI appearing briefly and then disappearing from the user's perspective.

#### Root Cause Analysis
- Multiple Node.js processes were running simultaneously on port 3000
- The nodemon process was not properly terminating previous instances
- Port 3000 was not being released properly between restarts
- Production and development servers conflicting on same ports

#### Error Logs
```
‚®Ø uncaughtException: Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:3000
    at <unknown> (Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:3000) {
  code: 'EADDRINUSE',
  errno: -98,
  syscall: 'listen',
  address: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 3000
}
```

#### Resolution Steps
1. **Force Kill Processes**: `pkill -9 -f "node|next|tsx|nodemon"`
2. **Port Management**: Temporarily changed server port to 3001 to free up port 3000
3. **Port Verification**: Used `netstat` and `ss` commands to verify port availability
4. **Production Server**: Started production server on port 8080 for stability
5. **Process Monitoring**: Implemented proper process cleanup in server startup script

#### Prevention Measures
- Implement proper process cleanup in server startup script
- Add port availability check before starting server
- Consider using process management tools like PM2 for production
- Use different ports for development and production environments

### 3. Database Schema Mismatch (RESOLVED)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
**Date**: June 20, 2025

The old AIAR project's API routes were trying to access database tables that didn't exist in the current Beacon project's schema, causing `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findMany')` errors.

#### Root Cause Analysis
- Old AIAR project had complex database schema with tables like `NewsArticle`, `ProcessingLog`, `NewsSource`
- Current Beacon project had minimal schema with only `User` and `Post` tables
- API routes were copied from AIAR project but database schema was not migrated
- Model references were incorrect in API endpoints

#### Error Logs
```
Error fetching logs: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findMany')
    at GET (src/app/api/automation/logs/route.ts:39:40)
    const logs = await db.processingLog.findMany({

Error fetching news: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findMany')
    at GET (src/app/api/news/route.ts:78:42)
    const articles = await db.newsArticle.findMany({
```

#### Resolution Steps
1. **Schema Analysis**: Identified that AIAR project was still present in `/aiarnew/` directory
2. **Model Updates**: Updated all API endpoints to use correct Beacon models
3. **Database Migration**: Created comprehensive Beacon-specific database schema
